# Objective


### 1. Connect with  a database using R

### 2. Run SQL (Structure Query Language) queries using RSQLite(package) and dplyr in R
---

# Database type and R packages

## R Package (left) and Database type (right):

.pull-left[
1. RMySQL

1. RPostgreSQL

1. RSQLite

1. odbc

1. bigrquery

]

.pull-right[
1. MySQL and MariaDB

1. Postgres and Redshift

1. SQLite

1. Many commercial databases

1. GoogleBigQuery

]

---

# File structure

### 1. Flat rectangular files

### 2. Longitudinal/multiwave study files (Hierarchical files)

### 3. *Relational Database (SQLite)*



```{r, out.width = "80%", echo=F}
  knitr::include_graphics("picture1.png")
```

---

# Connect



## Connect to database using  'RSQLite'  and 'dbplyr' (R packages)


### 1. Focuses on RETRIEVING and ANALYZING dataset (SELECT SQL statement).

### 2. It doesn’t MODIFY the dataset.

### 3. It doesn’t UPDATE or DELETE entries in database.

---

# Step 1 Packages required



```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(dbplyr)
library(RSQLite)
```

Downloaded the database for demonstration purpose.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
dir.create("data_raw", showWarnings = FALSE)
download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292171",
              destfile = "data_raw/portal_mammals.sqlite", mode = "wb")

```
---

# Step 2 Connect command

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

mammals <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(),"data_raw/portal_mammals.sqlite")

```

### 1. DBI allows R to send commands to database regardless of database mgmt system.

### 2. RSQLite package allows R to interface with SQLite database.

### 3. We are not loading data in R instead we are only connecting at this stage.

---

# Step 3 To view tables from the database


```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

src_dbi(mammals)

```


##  Argument 'src_dbi' views tables in the database. Here we got:

###- plots

###- species

###- surveys
---

# Step 4 Querying database with SQL syntax

```{r}
tbl(mammals, sql("SELECT year, species_id, plot_id FROM surveys"))

```

---
# Step 4 Continues...

### 1. To retrieve data from the tables in the database, you can connect using **tbl()** function from dplyr.

### 2. If you know SQL, you can use any SQL queries to work with the database.


### 3. But same operations can be done in dplyr instead of using SQL.


---

# Step 5 Querying database with dplyr syntax

```{r}
surveys <- tbl(mammals, "surveys")
surveys%>%
  select(year, species_id, plot_id)
head(surveys)

```


- Object 'surveys' behaves like a dataframe. 

- All the functions that we have used for dataframes can be applied here onwards.

---

# SQL Translation

- These dplyr commands are not executed by R. 

- It is sent to database and final result is retrieved.

- It brings only first 10 results (called dplyr 'Laziness')

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
surveys%>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)

```

---

# dplyr Laziness

- dplyr retrieves usually the first 10 results from the table.

- Commands like select or filter to retrieve data from database are not   executed by R. It is sent to the database and only final result is 
  retrived and displayed. 
  
- To retrieve all of the dplyr results from the database

```{r}
data_subset <- surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight) %>%
  collect()
```


- Now you have complete results from your query and you can continue working in R

---

# Last but not the least 

## Complex database queries

- You can use dplyr to connect with multiple tables.

- Did you know you can create a SQLite databse using csv files in R


Leaving that for you to explore.
